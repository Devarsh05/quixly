# Quixly — Project Memory

Autonomous agent that gets Shopify merchants' products recommended by AI shopping
engines (ChatGPT, Google AI Mode, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini), then verifies the
uplift. Full spec: see `PRD.md` (read it before large changes).

## Architecture at a glance
- `app/` — TypeScript, **Shopify React Router app template**. Handles OAuth, session storage,
  billing, webhooks, App Bridge + Polaris embedded UI. Thin Shopify-facing shell only.
- `agent/` — Python, **FastAPI + LangGraph**. The brain: engine querying, shopping-agent
  simulation, diagnosis, grounded optimization, publishing, verification. Async workers here.
- Postgres (+ pgvector) = primary store. Redis = queue/locks. Browserbase = browser sims.
- App shell ↔ agent service over an internal authenticated API. Agent also exposes an MCP server.
- Deploy: Railway (both services + Postgres + Redis).

## Commands
- Infra (both services): `docker compose up -d` (Postgres + Redis)
- App shell: `cd app && npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`
- Agent: `cd agent && uv sync` (or `pip install -e .`), `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Tests: app `npm test` (vitest); agent `pytest` (needs Postgres up)
- Worker (agent): `arq app.worker.WorkerSettings`
- DB migrations: agent `alembic upgrade head`; app `npx prisma migrate dev` (Session only)
- Note: `npm run typecheck` reports two pre-existing `s-app-nav` errors from the upstream
  template. Not ours; not yet fixed. CI runs lint/test/build, not typecheck.

## Working rules
- **Plan first** for anything spanning multiple files, new agent nodes, DB schema changes,
  or Shopify Admin API writes. Show the plan; wait for approval before editing.
- Prefer existing service wrappers before adding new abstractions.
- Python: typed (pydantic) everywhere, structured LLM outputs, no bare LLM calls in routes.
- TS: keep the React Router app thin — business/agent logic belongs in `agent/`, not `app/`.

## Schema ownership (one Postgres database, two migration tools)
Both services share one database. Each owns exactly one schema, and **neither tool may
touch the other's** — they have independent, mutually-destructive drift detection.

| Schema | Owner | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `shopify` | **Prisma** (`app/`) | `Session` + `_prisma_migrations`. **Nothing else, ever.** |
| `public`  | **Alembic** (`agent/`) | `shops`, `products`, `ingest_runs`, … everything else |

- The boundary is enforced on both sides. Prisma is scoped by `?schema=shopify` on the
  app's `DATABASE_URL`; Alembic is scoped by `include_object` in `agent/alembic/env.py`.
  Without those guards each tool sees the other's tables as drift and emits `DROP`s.
- **Never add a model to `app/prisma/schema.prisma`.** New tables are Alembic migrations
  in `agent/`. Prisma exists only because the Shopify session-storage adapter needs it.
- After changing either schema, run `alembic revision --autogenerate` and confirm the diff
  is **empty**. A non-empty diff means a guard is broken.
- `prisma migrate dev` is **LOCAL ONLY** — it can reset the database. Deployed
  environments run `prisma migrate deploy`.
- Same DB, two URL grammars: app uses `postgresql://`, agent uses `postgresql+asyncpg://`.

## Shopify token custody (the app shell is the single refresh authority)
Offline access tokens expire (~60 min). Minting a new one **retires the previous token and
invalidates its refresh token immediately**, so there can be exactly ONE refresher.

- The **app shell** is it: `unauthenticated.admin(shop)` refreshes within 5 minutes of
  expiry and persists the rotation. Do not disable
  `future.expiringOfflineAccessTokens` — public apps created after 2026-04-01 must use it.
- The **agent stores no Shopify credential.** No access token, no refresh token, no
  `shops.access_token_ref` column (PRD §8 is superseded on this point). It pulls
  short-lived tokens from `POST /internal/shops/:shop/admin-token` on the app shell.
- **All agent-side Admin API calls go through `TokenProvider`** (`agent/app/services/`).
  A second token path would be a second refresh authority and would silently break the
  first. Never fetch or cache a token anywhere else.
- **`/internal/shops/:shop/admin-token` status codes are load-bearing.** The agent decides
  permanence from them, so they must not be loosened:
  - **404 = PERMANENT** → agent flags `reauth_required` and stops. Covers *both* "no session
    row" *and* a dead refresh chain (`invalid_grant` / expired `refreshTokenExpires`).
  - **502 = TRANSIENT** → agent retries. Shopify 5xx, network, throttling.
  Mapping a dead chain to 502 would retry a 90-day-idle shop forever and never surface it.
  Note `unauthenticated.admin()` cannot make this distinction — it flattens every OAuth
  error except `invalid_subject_token` into an anonymous 500 — which is why
  `app/lib/admin-token.server.ts` performs the refresh itself via `api.auth.refreshToken`.
- Jobs fetch tokens at the *start of the task*, never at enqueue time — a queued job can
  outlive a 60-minute token.
- Refresh tokens die after **90 days of disuse**. Weekly scans keep the chain warm; a shop
  idle 90+ days gets `shops.status = reauth_required` and must re-auth. Never let this
  degrade into a silent 401.

## Risk zones (extra care — explain before touching)
- **Never publish to a merchant's Shopify store without an explicit approval gate.**
  Publishing flows through `fixes.status = approved` only.
- **Never fabricate product attributes, specs, GTINs, or reviews.** Optimizer may only
  enrich/restructure from verified source data; every fix carries a before/after diff + source.
- Do not edit OAuth, session storage, billing, or webhook-verification code without first
  explaining the risk.
- Secrets: never hardcode or print API keys / Shopify tokens. Use env vars; keep local
  secrets in gitignored `.env` / `CLAUDE.local.md`. `INTERNAL_API_KEY` must match exactly
  across `app/.env` and `agent/.env`.
- The internal API (`/internal/*` on the app shell; `/shops`, `/webhooks` on the agent) is
  service-to-service and shared-secret authenticated. Never link it from the UI or expose
  it publicly.

## Verification
- After DB or route changes: run the relevant tests and `npm run build` / `uvicorn` boot check.
- After any Optimizer change: run the grounding test suite (asserts no attribute is emitted
  that isn't present in source fixtures).
- After a Publisher change: run against the dev store only; re-read the published page and
  confirm it parses.

## Conventions
- Monorepo; keep `app/` and `agent/` independently runnable.
- Agent graph nodes live in `agent/app/graph/` — one file per node.
- Do not put running task lists or plans in this file (they go stale) — those live in the PR/issue.

## Git
- **Never add AI attribution to commits or PRs.** No `Co-Authored-By: Claude`/AI trailers, no
  "Generated with Claude Code" lines, no AI mentions in commit messages or PR bodies. Write
  commit messages as the human author, plainly describing the change.
